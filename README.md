# Gengo YAML

[Gengo YAML](https://leighmcculloch.github.com/gengo-yaml) will convert your i18n YAML files, for Rails or whatever, into Gengo friendly submissions and back again.

## Usage

1. Go to [leighmcculloch.github.com/gengo-yaml](https://leighmcculloch.github.com/gengo-yaml)
2. Paste your i18n YAML into the left box
3. Gengo friendly text will appear in the right box
4. Click the `Translate with Gengo` button and you'll be redirected to Gengo with the text included in a translation order ready for you to configure the languages you want it translated to

## Why

I created [greatstories.org](https://greatstories.org) and have recently started translating it into as many languages as possible. Converting the YAML into Gengo text was quickly tedious. I looked around and found i18n management tools, but I didn't need everything they provided and I'd incur a monthly ongoing cost. I needed a _simple_ tool to make my manual task a relatively automated one. I need a tool that converted the YAML into a format friendly for Gengo, made it easy to get it into Gengo, and back again. 

## Limitations

* The conversion is only one way, two way is coming
* The conversion isn't perfect, improvements to come
